# AIHW4
Artificial Intelligence HW4 - Naive Bayes Classifier


Authors: Quinlan McGaugh and Otis Milliken


Reflection (Part I):

Failures:

1. "I hate my AI class!"
This one fails because, somewhat surprisingly, "ai" is a very positive word according to our training data. We see the probability of "AI" given positive is nearly 10x the probability of seeing "AI" given negative:
"AI" | Neg: 3.1044543985029585E-5
"AI" | Pos: 1.7849849745647407E-4

It was also difficult because the text was only five words, two of which were "filler" words (I and my), which were roughly even probabilities between positive and negative.
